      question: "How do I take a survey?",
      answer: "If a survey matches your profile, you will receive an email in your registered e-mail ID or via SMS or WhatsApp Messaging, with a link that will re-direct you to take the survey. We request you to check all these three mediums regularly to participate in surveys and earn I-Points. The more up-to-date your profile surveys are, the more chances you have, of being invited to take part in surveys and earn I-Points."
    },
    {
      question: "How often will I receive a survey?",
      answer: "The number of surveys you receive varies on the number of surveys being run at any given time. At times there may be many all at once, and at other times there may be only a few. The profile information you enter is very important in ensuring that you can be matched to as many surveys as possible. If you keep your 'Member Profile' complete and up to date, you will receive the maximum number of surveys that you qualify for."
    },
    {
        question: "Why am I asked questions about age, income and other personal information?",
        answer: "We ask for personal information such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and employment status to better match you with the appropriate market research projects. This information is also used for incentive fulfilment so that we may send your reward to the appropriate recipient address. Other personal information that you may be asked to provide to us is solely for the purpose of building and operating a worldwide proprietary database of panelists, in order to conduct market research studies on that basis and we provide your responses to our surveys on to our clients in anonymised and aggregated form. Read our privacy policy to know more."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between member profiles and surveys?",
        answer: "Member profiles tell us a little about you and allow us to target you for surveys that match your interests or experience. You can complete these at your leisure in the 'My Profile' area. Surveys are studies in which you will be asked to provide your opinions on specific products, services or advertisements. Surveys are open only for a limited time, until response quotas are met. Occasionally, a study has very specific qualifications that only a small percentage of the population will meet, such a situation might occur when a pharmaceutical company requests feedback from sufferers of a rare disease. In cases like these, it may be necessary to query the entire panel using survey screeners in order to find the handful of panelists who meet the qualifications for a study. Please remember to update your profile and keep it up to date, in order to earn more I-Points."

      {
        question: "Is there a joining fee?",

    },
    {
        question: "How long will it take to receive my reward once ordered?",
        answer: "The timing of crediting for I-Points depends on the survey. For some surveys, I-Points are credited very quickly or within a few days, while for others you will receive the I-Points only after the survey has closed. You can expect to wait a maximum of six weeks for I-Points to be credited to your account from when a survey closes, though we try to limit this as much as possible."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I earn I-Points?",
        answer: "First, you must be a registered IndiaPolls member with a verified email address to begin accumulating I-Points. Once your registration is finalised, you can earn I-Points by completing surveys found here on IndiaPolls or through invites you receive via email/WhatsApp or SMS.

Your opinion will have a direct impact on companies and how they market, distribute or advertise new products and services to consumers like you."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I participate in closed surveys?",
        answer: "Each survey has fixed quotas. When a survey reaches the required number of respondents, it will automatically close and no more responses will be accepted. This can happen sooner than the estimated end date depending on response from members, so please join as soon as it is convenient for you to avoid missing the opportunity of earning I-Points."
    },
    {
        question: "I tried to take a survey, but I didn't qualify?",
        answer: "Sometimes a survey demands respondents who meet very specific criteria. This is because our clients might require feedback from a specific age group or people who use a particular type of product. To increase your chances for qualifying for future online surveys, complete all of your member profiles to earn more I-Points."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is the survey full when I just received the invitation a short time ago?",
        answer: "Sometimes this happens if a survey is generating greater than expected responses. Also, the invitations aren't necessarily delivered right away by your email service provider. Therefore, we advise all our members to keep checking their WhatsApp or SMS along with emails, so that they don't miss any opportunity to earn I-Points. We do apologize for any inconvenience you may experience and thank you for your participation. Please know that more survey opportunities will become available for you in some time soon."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the length of each survey?",
        answer: "Survey length is strictly dependent on the study but a typical survey length ranges between 20 minutes and 40 minutes."
    },
    {
        question: "I have not received any surveys for a long time. How long should I wait?",
        answer: "In your account, any available surveys will be shown in the 'My Surveys' tab. Members are invited to take part in surveys according to the specific need and requirements of each survey. Invitations will be sent automatically as soon as a suitable survey is launched. The profile information you enter is very important in ensuring that you can be matched to as many surveys as possible.

    },
    {

        question: "How do you know if my responses are accurate?",

    {
        question: "Surveys on Mobile: How can I participate in surveys on mobile?",
        answer: "If you would like to receive surveys on your smartphone, simply enter your mobile phone number on IndiaPolls during your registration or directly on your account page.
