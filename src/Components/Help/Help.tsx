                    <p>&nbsp; This gives us a list of all surveys present in the system. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; On click of export button admin will have the ability to export the data displayed in grid in form of a csv file</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; Admin can filter surveys on basis of Publish Date , Expiry Date , Survey Name , Client Name and Survey Type</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; By default filters are set as follows:-</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; On clicking survey details button next to a particular survey admin will land on the survey details page of that particular survey.</p>
